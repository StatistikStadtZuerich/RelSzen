# life expectancy


# life expectancy based on mortality rate (based on Yusuf et al. 2014)

# method differences (rate vs. deaths/births/population)
#-age capped (if only below a age threshold): rate aggregation does not make sense
#-population Px: not average population over a year,
#  here the rate is based on population at the end of the previous year
#-qx not with births (probability to die between age x and age x+1): at age zero: with births
#-Lx_ (person-years lived) at maximum age: cannot be calculated as dx / mx, since dx (deaths) are not available

# based on Yusuf F., Martins J. M., Swanson D. A., 2014. Methods of Demographic Analysis.
